myInvoice was developed in 2015 to help my wife in the management of her invoices and clients and has been my first real attemp in the world of professional programming. It is based on the MEAN Stack and the following technologies were used:
- server and RESTfull API built with Node.js and Express v4;
- MongoDB as database and Mongoose as ORM;
- AngularJS 1.3 for FE;
- Animations with ng-animate & animate.css;
- Use of several custom directives ngToast, ng-message, charts with angular-chart.js...
- dynamic styling of the app

The app has been published on [Heroku](http://corbeinvoice.herokuapp.com/login)
